	<br><br>
	<p> 
		Hey - I'm Nicole Biller. I'm currently a graduate student in the Earth and Environmental Sciences department at Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.
	<br><br>
		As a scientist I am interested in improving our understanding of Earthâ€™s climate system and how it has changed in the past, so that we have a better idea of what to expect from anthropogenic driven climate changes in the future.
	<br><br>
		I also recently completed two years of Teach for America, teaching 8th grade science at Northridge Middle School in Charlotte, N.C. (Go Hawks!) 
	<br><br>
		To get a hold of me, you can 
		<a class="link" href="mailto:billern%40bc%2eedu?subject=Hi,%20Nikki&amp;body="> 
		shoot me an email 
		</a>
		or stop by Devlin Hall during my office hours.
